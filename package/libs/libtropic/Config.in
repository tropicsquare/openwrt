	  Libtropic is a C SDK library for application development with TROPIC01
	  secure element. It provides APIs for secure communication, cryptographic
	  operations, and hardware abstraction for TROPIC01 chip integration.
	  
	  This package builds libtropic as a static library. Applications need to
	  configure the appropriate HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and CAL 
	  (Crypto Abstraction Layer) when linking against this library.
	  
	  Supported platforms:
	    - Linux SPI
	    - POSIX TCP (for testing with model)
	    - POSIX USB dongle
	  
	  Crypto backend:
	    - MbedTLS v4
